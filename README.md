## Getting Started

Clone repository to your local environment. 

```
  git clone https://github.com/Raerka/test_task.git
```

Before starting work with module, be sure, that you have installed Node.js.

Install all needed dependencies through npm.

```
  npm install
```

For running test cases with Grunt you need to install Grunt's command line 
interface (CLI) globally.

```
  npm install -g grunt-cli
```

This will put the grunt command in your system path, allowing it to be run 
from any directory.

## Running module

For running module and watch how it works you need print in your CL

```
  npm run start
```

It runs index.js file and output results


## Running tests

For running test cases trough npm just print in CL

```
  npm run test
```

For running test cases with Grunt just print in CL

```
  grunt
```

It runs test cases with grunt based on Gruntfile.js
